# TCP-Latency

This code is a fork of the tcp-latency repository and adds a graphical user interface (GUI) to the existing functionality. The GUI is implemented using the Tkinter library in Python.

The code measures the latency (round-trip time) between a client and a server using TCP connections. It calculates the latency by establishing a connection to the specified host and port and measuring the time it takes for the connection to be established and closed.
